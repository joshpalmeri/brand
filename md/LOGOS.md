## Logo Identity

The Suffolk County Community College logo was designed to create a visual representation of the College's identity.

As the trademark for the College, it is of utmost importance that the logo be used consistently when applied to any internal or external communication. The College logo is a representation of the College brand and it exists in the minds of community members as the iconic representation of the school. 

## Requests for Department Logos

In most cases, the Suffolk logo is the official mark of the College and should be used to represent College departments and programs. 

However, in some instances a program or department may require an additional logo to help distinguish their own identity. On such occasions, the department must obtain approval from the Office of Institutional Advancement (see [Department Names](#)).

## Approved Usage

With regard to logo usage outside of the College, permission must be secured any time an individual, entity or organization requests the use of the official College logo. The College has secured all rights and trademarks for the use of the logo.
